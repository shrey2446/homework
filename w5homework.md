## What is the **Internet**?

The internet as we know it is a series of interconnected networks (wires) that facilitate communication
between computers across the globe. The internet remains a global phenomenon due to the transmission control protocol or the internet protocol
that allows us to transmit data via various types of media.

#### HISTORICAL CONTEXT

Various countries during the span of history developed their versions of the internet separately. Donald Davies, the co-inventor of packet switching, had built
Mark I at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK. Norway had developed NORSAR. France had launched cyclades.
The U.S. government began building a computer network in the 1960s known as ARPANET.
All of these were scaled down versions of the internet because they could not communicate with each other - due to their different rules.

Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf decided on creating an universal internet protocol or the TCP/IP (transmission control protocol / internet protocol) that allowed communication across countries.
The internet soon after became the hotspot for the scientific and academic communities. The launching of the first website though really made the internet a more public phenomenon.
