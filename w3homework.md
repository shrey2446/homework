# 100 Ideas That Changed the Web

### Idea No.19: The Emoticon

#### *What is a 'flame war' and what does it have to do with emoticons?*

A 'flame war' refers to the exchange of abusive or aggressive messages
that usually express opposing views on an online forum or discussion board.
Initially having started in the 1900s, flame wars were a result of
misunderstandings online when people couldn't tell apart an article to be taken
seriously and a joke.

As a problem solution to this, a Research professor Scott Fahlam
suggested they mark jokes and serious articles with different character sequences.
the colon :, dash -, and close bracket ) for a joke :-) and the colon :, dash - and open bracket ( for something that isnt a joke :-(

That was the birth of emoticon. A simplified representation of a happy and sad face to mark articles online, to prevent misunderstandings.


#### *What's the difference between an emoticon and an emoji? Support your answer with references beyond the book.*

An emoticon is the simplified representation of human facial expressions using symbols like colons, brackets and more, while an emoji
is a graphical representation, an image, of the human express. Emoticons are limited by the
non-alphanumerical symbols on keyboards but emojis are only limited by our imagination and ability to draw.


### Idea No.24: The JPEG

#### *Boulton explains that a JPEG file has 'lossy' compression. Explain what this means. List and explain a few other kinds of image file compression and the image file types associated with them.*

A 'lossy' compression in JPEG format is a form of data encoding that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent content. This is used to reduce data size for storing, handling and transmitting content.

Another type of compression is the 'lossless' compression that combines runs of similar data and stores them in a single value count that allows for compressing without reducing the file quantity.
Lossless compressing is used for simple graphic files with long runs of identical data elements. DEFLATE is a type of lossless data compression method used for PNG, Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) is used to compress GIF and some TIFF file formats.

### Idea No.45: Metadata

#### *List and explain a few examples of metadata beyond the examples given in the book.*

Metadata is data about data.
Some examples mentioned in the book are how it was created, when it was created, and by whom it was created. The dimensions of an image, the location where an image was taken or uploaded from, I.P. address used to enter or access information on the web, bank IRF numbers, account numbers, routing numbers, I assume, are forms of metadata.

Libraries use cards to sort by title, author, subject and an alphanumerical code. Digital photographs, websites, etc, all have metadata about them.
