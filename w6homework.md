# 100 Ideas That Changed the Web

### Idea No. 12: Bulletin Board Systems

*In the early days of the Internet, different communities from gamers to artists to journalists to fans of various things started their own BBSs. What are some examples of early BBSs that aren't mentioned in the book. Support your answer with sources. (extra props if you can find a BBS that is still active and you can figure out how to visit it!)*

Some early local BBSs were:
- Octopus's Garden
- Southern Pride
- Online's Place
- The Keep BBS
- Capitol City Online BBS
- sixteencolors.net
- BBS.net

(I visited a BBS via a web browser instead of downloading/dialing it)

### Idea No. 36: GeoCities

*The book mentions that Yahoo! purchased GeoCities and that, because they were loosing money on it, Yahoo! would eventually announce that they would be shutting it down. However, it did not mention the fact that this annoucement was made only a few months before the shut down. Yahoo! would be deleting all the data on the GeoCities servers, this meant thousands of early user generated websites would disappear from the Internet forever. Fortunately, some folks found those websites to be important and valuable pieces of Internet history and took action to try and preserve some of these sites. Who are these people? What did they do to save GeoCities? Support your answer with sources.*

"The Archive Team is a loose collective of rogue archivists, programmers, writers and loudmouths dedicated to saving our digital heritage. Since 2009 this variant force of nature has caught wind of shutdowns, shutoffs, mergers, and plain old deletions - and done our best to save the history before it's lost forever." This is the same team that is responsible for the preservation of GeoCities.

The Archive Team used a deep crawler to download and preserve as many GeoCities as they could and then compressed them into a 0.65 terabytes file that can be downloaded from BitTorrent.

You can also merely browse one of the several mirrors the Archive Team has set up at reocities.com, geociti.es, geocities.ws and oocities.org.
