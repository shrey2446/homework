# SOPHIA

A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer
— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.
 Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control
 may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to take on human
 form but most robots are machines designed to
perform a task with no regard to how they look. Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong based company Hanson Robotics. Sophia was activated on February 14, 2016.

#### FEATURES
The robot, modeled after actress Audrey Hepburn, is known for human-like appearance and behavior compared to previous robotic variants.
According to the manufacturer, David Hanson, Sophia uses artificial intelligence, visual data processing and facial recognition. Sophia also
imitates human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics
(e.g. on the weather). Sophia uses voice recognition (speech-to-text) technology from Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google) and is designed
to get smarter over time. Sophia's intelligence software is designed by Hanson Robotics. The AI program analyses conversations and extracts data
that allows it to improve responses in the future.

Cameras within Sophia's eyes combined with computer algorithms allow her to see. It can follow faces, sustain eye contact, and recognize individuals.
It is able to process speech and have conversations using a natural language subsystem. Around January 2018 Sophia was
upgraded with functional legs and the ability to walk.

Sophia is conceptually similar to the computer program ELIZA, which was one of the first attempts at simulating a human conversation between a human and a computer by Joseph Weizenbaum in January 1966. The software has
been programmed to give pre-written responses to specific questions or phrases, like a chatbot. These responses are used to create the illusion that
the robot is able to understand conversation, including stock answers to questions like "Is the door open or shut?" The information is shared in a
cloud network which allows input and responses to be analyzed with blockchain technology.

#### BY THE CREATOR

Hanson designed Sophia to be a suitable companion for the elderly at nursing homes,
or to help crowds at large events or parks. He has said that he hopes that the robot can
ultimately interact with other humans sufficiently to gain social skills.

David Hanson has said that Sophia would ultimately be a good fit to serve in healthcare, customer service, therapy and education. Sophia runs on
artificially intelligent software that is constantly being trained in the lab, so its conversations are likely to get faster, Sophia's expressions
are likely to have fewer errors, and it should answer increasingly complex questions with more accuracy.

Sophia has nine robot humanoid “siblings” who were also created by Hanson Robotics.
 Fellow Hanson robots are Alice, Albert Einstein Hubo, BINA48, Han, Jules, Professor
 Einstein, Philip K. Dick Android, Zeno, and Joey Chaos.


### HUMANOID ROBOTS
A humanoid robot is a robot with its body shape built to resemble the human body. The design may be for
functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes,
such as the study of bipedal locomotion, or for other purposes.
