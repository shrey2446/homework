# ** *5 IDEAS* **

## 1. *3D Printing*

 3D printing isn't as new as it seems. Having filled out the first of the patents for this machine in 1886, 3D printers were a result of the stereolithography (SLA) technique invented by Charles Hull that allowed designers to create tangible objects using digital data. He founded the 3D Systems Corporation and a year later, released the SLA-1.In 1988, at the University of Texas, Carl Deckard brought a patent for the SLS technology, another 3D printing technique in which powder grains are fused together locally by a laser.In the meantime, Scott Crump, a co-founder of Stratasys Inc. filed a patent for Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM): the third of the main 3D printing technologies. 2009 was the year in which the FDM patents fell into the public domain, opening the way to a wide wave of innovation in FDM 3D printers, a drop of the desktop 3D printers price, and consequently, since the technology was more accessible, an increased visibility.Ever since, they have been used to print kidneys, prosthetic limbs, design innovations and more.

## 2. *Babel Fish*

Yahoo! Babel Fish was a free Web-based multilingual translation application. The internet service derived its name from the Babel fish, a fictional species in Douglas Adams's book and radio series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy that could instantly translate languages. In turn, the name of the fictional creature refers to the biblical account of the confusion of languages that arose in the city of Babel.On December 9, 1997, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and SYSTRAN S.A. launched AltaVista Translation Service at babelfish.altavista.com,[5] which was developed by a team of researchers at DEC. In February 2003, AltaVista was bought by Overture Services, Inc. In July 2003, Overture, in turn, was taken over by Yahoo!. Ever since, multiple online translators have emerged, from Microsoft's Bing Translator to Google translate, in the modern 21st century there are no gaps in communication when it comes to languages. Launched in 2017, the Google Pixel Buds are the dream AI reality of the babel fish, they allow instant translation between 40 languages. They aren't the first though, the Google translate app, Microsoft's Skype Translator, Bragi Dash Pro all do the same, its all down to customer prefernce now.

## 3. *Solar Panels*

Photovoltaic solar panels absorb sunlight as a source of energy to generate electricity. A photovoltaic (PV) module is a packaged, connected assembly of typically 6x10 photovoltaic solar cells. Photovoltaic modules constitute the photovoltaic array of a photovoltaic system that generates and supplies solar electricity in commercial and residential applications. In 1839, the ability of some materials to create an electrical charge from light exposure was first observed by Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel. In 1881, Charles Fritts created the first commercial solar panel, which was reported by Fritts as "continuous, constant and of considerable force not only by exposure to sunlight but also to dim, diffused daylight." Due to their inefficiency when compared to a coal-fired power plant, they weren't mass produced. In 1939, Russell Ohl created the solar cell design that is used in many modern solar panels. He patented his design in 1941. In 1954, this design was first used by Bell Labs to create the first commercially viable silicon solar cell. Now a major game player in mainstream energy, solar power is easily harvested at lower prices due to the major corporate competitors.

## 4. *Sophia*

Sophia is a realistic humanoid robot capable of displaying humanlike expressions and interacting with people. It's/She's designed for research, education, and entertainment, and helps promote public discussion about AI ethics and the future of robotics. A humanoid robot is a robot with its body shape built to resemble the human body. The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of bipedal locomotion, or for other purposes.The word "robot" first appeared in 1921, in Karel Capek’s play R.U.R., or Rossum's Universal Robots. “Robot” comes from the Czech for “forced labor.” These robots were robots more in spirit than form, though. It wasn’t until the 1960s that a company built a machine that could perform tasks autonomously while sensing and manipulating it's environment. That’s when SRI International in Silicon Valley developed Shakey, the first truly mobile and perceptive robot. This tower on wheels was well-named—awkward, slow, twitchy. Equipped with a camera and bump sensors, Shakey could navigate a complex environment. It wasn’t a particularly confident-looking machine, but it was the beginning of the robotic revolution. What followed were robots with arms to perform tasks in manufacturing plants, robots for scientific purposes and robots to study humans.

## 5. *Data Storage - DNA*

Over millennia, nature has evolved an incredible information storage medium – DNA. It evolved to store genetic information, blueprints for building proteins, but DNA can be used for many more purposes than just that. DNA is also much denser than modern storage media: The data on hundreds of thousands of DVDs could fit inside a matchbox-size package of DNA. DNA is also much more durable – lasting thousands of years – than today’s hard drives, which may last years or decades. And while hard drive formats and connection standards become obsolete, DNA never will, at least so long as there’s life. The idea of storing digital data in DNA is several decades old, but recent work from Harvard and the European Bioinformatics Institute showed that progress in modern DNA manipulation methods could make it both possible and practical today. Many research groups, including at the ETH Zurich, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Columbia University are working on this problem. To store data in DNA, the concept is the same, but the process is different. DNA molecules are long sequences of smaller molecules, called nucleotides – adenine, cytosine, thymine and guanine, usually designated as A, C, T and G. Rather than creating sequences of 0s and 1s, as in electronic media, DNA storage uses sequences of the nucleotides.To read the data back out of storage, we use a sequencing machine exactly like those used for analysis of genomic DNA in cells. This identifies the molecules, generating a letter sequence per molecule, which we then decode into a binary sequence of 0s and 1s in order. This process can destroy the DNA as it is read- hence multiple copies are made and stored.
